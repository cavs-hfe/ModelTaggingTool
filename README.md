# ModelTaggingTool
Tool for tagging 3D models

To set up:

1. Clone or download repo as ZIP.
2. Open project in VS12 or VS13 (need to have NuGet to download packages).
3. Build project. NuGet should download required packages automatically.

The User Interface:
1. The interface consists of three main parts. On the left is a list of all 
models loaded into the database. On the right is a tree showing available tags 
in the hirarchy. The middle section will show the 3D model once one is loaded.
2. The toolbars above the tag and model sections have buttons that allow you to 
add new, refresh, or delete selected objects from the respective lists.
3. The status bar at the bottom of the UI shows the username that will be attached 
to new tags, as well as the current path to the model directory.
